## Tools and Technologies  
- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)  
- K-Means clustering  

## Approach  
- Preprocessed galaxy data for feature scaling and normalization.  
- Applied K-Means with different values of *k*.  
- Evaluated clustering performance using inertia and silhouette scores.  

## Key Outcomes  
- Successfully grouped galaxies into visually distinct clusters.  
- Showed that unsupervised learning can uncover structure in astronomical datasets.
